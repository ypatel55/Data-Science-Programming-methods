# Project Description
All throughout the country, people of color face struggles whether it be with lack of opportunities or unfair treatment. This project will explore how race and other attributes of characteristics affect one's arrest details, specifically how people of color generally have different arrest details than white individuals. Overall, I will use modeling techniques and visualizations to display trends seen in society regarding inequality with local data from our college town of Champaign, IL. 

The topic of my project also focuses on "Transcription: Converting from an existing implementation into another one". This R Markdown project will convert this [Dashboard](https://ypatel55.github.io/CS416/index.html) created by me using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS into R. I will go deeper into the dataset by anaylzing linear regression models, performing F tests, and Tukey tests in terms of what variables actually have a relationship with arrest details. By modeling the data, I will be able to visualize the specific variables that are significant and show their effects.

# Data Source
This project will be using the dataset from the Champaign County Sheriff Office that has data about the demographics of the jail bookings of those who were arrested in the area between the years 2011-2016. We will focus on arrest bookings throughout the years in the town of Champaign, IL.
